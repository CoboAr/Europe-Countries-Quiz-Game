# Europe-Countries-Quiz-Game
This a quiz game where the player has to find 49 countries of Europe. This game is implemented with pandas and turtle python libraries.
## How does it work?
When the player runs main.py, a screen with size 960x950 px will appear. The screen contains a blank map of the European continent and a prompt that asks the user to guess an European country. The prompt also keep track of the correct guesses of the player. Main.py read all the countries from "49_European_Countries.csv" file and creates a list. When the user makes a correct guess the score will be updated, the name of the country guessed will be drawn into the map on top of the country guessed, and slowly the map will get populated. If the user enter "exit" as input, a new csv file named "countries_to_learn.csv" will be generated containig all the missed countries. The user can learn these countries and can try to get a better score next time.
